agents/hider.py

This module defines the Hider agent for the multi-agent hide and seek project.
The hiderâ€™s role is to hide from the seeker.
It stores the agent's state (position and direction) and provides methods to update the state
and process actions. Debug output is standardized using the custom logger.
